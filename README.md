# Swearword-Counter
A short swearword counter discord bot that's also a self bot

**Notes 📝**
- I didn't use the command framework because lazy 🥱
- Message intents bypass works by taking most recent message in channel history when `on_message` is triggered. This bypass won't work for servers that constantly recieve hunderd of messages because the bot will hit rate limits
- An instance of the bot will only work for **1** server, this bot is not meant to be deployed for public use!

**Setup ⚙️**
1. Import repository preferably to [Replit](https://replit.com/repls)
2. Download discord-py v 1.7.3 (`pip install discord-py==1.7.3`)
3. Copy your token and run it. ctrl/cmd+shift+i -> application -> Local Storage -> `https://discord.com` -> token
4. Add blacklisted words to `blacklisted.txt`
5. Setup a pinger to keep the bot alive, [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard)
